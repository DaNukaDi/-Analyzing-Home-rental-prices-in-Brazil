## General Discussion and conclusions

    • As the Spearman correlation value, we could conclude that there is a positive correlation
    between Area and property taxes. That means property taxes are related to the Property 
    area.
    
    • If the House is furnished the fire Insurance value is high. That’s mean, Fire insurance is
    related to the Furnished or not.
    
    • The property taxes vary from city to city In Brazil. Some cities charge a higher rate, and 
    some cities charge a lower rate.
    
    • The Fire Insurance varies from city to city. Some Cities have faced forest fires several
    times in the year. Therefore, those city householders have to pay higher taxes than the 
    others. In our case, São Paulo citizens have to pay higher taxes than the other city 
    citizens.
    
    • If customers who are rent a new house depends on whether pets are allowed or not. If the 
    House owner accepts the keeping animals, the rent amount is increased. therefore, the 
    rent amount is related to the Keeping animal or not
